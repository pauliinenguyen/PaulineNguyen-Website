        <p class="lead mb-4">As a dedicated student with a history of meeting superiors' goals and expectations, I have the ability of utilizing consistent and organized practices. I am a dependable candidate who is successful at managing multiple priorities with a positive attitude. I also have the grit and willingness to take on added responsibilities in order to meet team goals. Professionally speaking, I am currently inexperienced; however, I have had many leadership roles and experiences throughout my high school career. For instance, I was in the Associated Student Body (ASB) with the purpose of organizing a program with over 400 freshman students to gain advice and tips on adjusting to high school by their mentors, who were upperclassmen such as juniors and seniors. I joined my senior year of high school in order to gain a broader leadership experience and truly connect with the student body after having been attending the school for three years; the position I was given was the Co-Mariner Mentor Chair. <br><br>

        Within that program, I programmed multiple workshops throughout the school year for over two hundred members to communicate advice with another, as well as stimulate bonding time between the mentors and mentees. With my team, we created social media campaigns to be launched onto Instagram, which resulted in positive feedback from both the faculty and students over the years. I also documented and resolved attendance and communication issues between mentors and mentees. As a result, it led to an increase of attendance and efficiency of communication by fifty percent. Not only that, but I was also an officer in my high school’s Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or otherwise known as NJROTC from my freshman to junior year of high school. It was a program to provide cadets with an opportunity to learn about followership and leadership as well as to become a competitive member in the drill, academic, and athletic teams. I applied to become an officer near the end of my freshman year, and was one of the four freshmen that were selected to become officers. <br><br>

        Each year, I was given a new job and responsibility to our Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps unit. As an officer, I assisted with the organization and execution of activities that resulted in more than fifty new members. Through the years, I qualified for the state Super Brawl which was the academic competition for two years, and the state Super Bowl for all three years which is a drill-focused competition. I was able to qualify with the help of my fellow officers and members through both attending and commanding a team for more than five hours of after school practice a week. Another one of my responsibilities included documenting and resolving drill team conflicts, which led to our team placing third in the state competition. With the combination of these leadership roles, I have gained and polished my skills of planning and coordination, communication, collaboration, and multitasking abilities. With these past high school experiences, I am currently in my first year in university, navigating my way to gaining more opportunities and experiences. <br><br>
